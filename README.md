# VVVVVV: Make and Play Edition: 3DS Homebrew
A port of VVVVVV: Make and Play edition to Nintendo 3DS Homebrew.

# Playing
These builds come with all the code necessary to play the M&P edition, but you will have to download the data.zip file from [here](https://thelettervsixtim.es/makeandplay/). Place it in the same directory as the build binary, and you're good to go.

# Building
Simply set up a 3DS Homebrew build environment and run `make` in your terminal. This will generate a build binary at the root of the repo directory.

# License/Disclaimer Notice
This code is licensed under the VVVVVV Source Code License v1.0, and can be read in the LICENSE.md file. Do not redistribute the data.zip file without express permission. This project uses SDL, *not* SDL2 (same for SDL Mixer). The icon is a recreation of the 3DS icon but rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This project was an experiment for me to see how well I could port someone else's code to an entirely different platform, and is intended for educational or personal use only.
